The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the Sun and
Dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Went up the spout again!

The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the Sun and
Dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Went up the spout again!

The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the Sun and
Dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Went up the spout again!
